Usage/how to use

- On the first opening of "Florish" users are taken directly to the home screen with the plant icon
  and the drink and water buttons. The home screen also contains the current BAC (Blood Alcohol Concentration)
  displayed, the icon for more information on BAC, the history page on the top left hand side, and "Florish" info page
  as well as the personal settings page on the upper right.

- "Florish" is a touch based app, thus all menus and pages are touch accessible.

- The app is based on user inputs be it a standard drink or a water cup. The plant animates based on the user
  stimulus, to show the effects of alcohol. The BAC updates based on the number of drinks and the time spanned
  through the inputs.
